# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
My recommendations are as follows for Louise and her chosen play based on analysis
- In the US, more than 60% of kickstarter campaigns for plays were successful
- ![Play Campaigns Outcomes in the US](C:\Users\Sara\Desktop\Analysis Projects\Crowdfunding Project)
- The most successul plays launched in May and June while the least successful month was December

- The Top 5 most successful plays based on percentage funded in the US is Shakespeare Orange County's HAMLET: Match This!, Terminator the Second, REALLY REALLY, Much Ado About Nothing & Howard's End 
  - Of these 5, my recommendation would be to do REALLY REALLY as the play received 300% of its goal, A low initial goal of only $1,000, had an average donation of $58.57 with only 49 backers and length of campaign was only 2x weeks
  - My second choice would be for Terminator the Second as the play received 300% of its goal, with the average goal of $3,000 close to the median and within the quartiles after running a statistical analysis. This play however did have over 240 backers and took a month to complete.
 - As there was also interest in Great Britain, more than 75% of kickstarter campaigns were successful
   - Of the GB plays that were of interest to you, I'd recommend Cutting Off Kate Bush as it was the only one to achieve over 200% of goal
