# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
My recommendations are as follows for Louise and her chosen play based on analysis
- In the US, more than 60% of kickstarter campaigns for plays were successful
- The most successul plays launched in May and June while the least successful month was December
- The Top 5 most successful plays based on percentage funded in the US is Shakespeare Orange County's HAMLET: Match This!, Terminator the Second, REALLY REALLY, Much Ado About Nothing & Howard's End 
  - Of these 5, my recommendation would be to do REALLY REALLY as the play received 300% of its goal, A low initial goal of only $1,000, had an average donation of $58.57 with only 49 backers and length of campaign was only 2x weeks
  - My second choice would be for Terminator the Second as the play received 300% of its goal, with the average goal of $3,000 close to the median and within the quartiles after running a statistical analysis. This play however did have over 240 backers and took a month to complete.
 - As there was also interest in Great Britain, more than 75% of kickstarter campaigns were successful
   - Of the GB plays that were of interest to you, I'd recommend Cutting Off Kate Bush as it was the only one to achieve over 200% of goal
### Challenge
After analyzing the results of the kickstarter campaigns, my recommendations to Louis are as follows:
- 76% of successful campaigns had a goal amount of $5,000 or less. Keep it in this range for higher success. 
- Successful campaigns for the parent category Theater started in May and June. The worst months to start a campaign fall during November and December when supporters might have holidays on their mind instead.

- No play campaigns were canceled and of all plays, 66% of campaigns were successful regardless of goal range with only 34% failure rate. Favorable odds in general.
- In terms of length of campaigns and success, more data will need to be calculated. By subtracting date ended from date created to also analyze how length contributes to success. This can be analyzed calculating the average length of success campaigns to see how long funding will take. Please be aware of outliers that will skew the data.
